# Portfolio Website
This is the code for my scrapbook themed portfolio website! Check it out at [davidrwen.com](davidrwen.com)!

## Running it locally

Running it locally is as simple as running the following:

```bash
# Replace 'npm' with whatever package manager you like (eg: yarn)
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment
I deploy this website on AWS using a combination of S3 + CloudFront + Route53. 
Checkout my GHA in `.github/workflows/cicd.yml` to see how I do this.
